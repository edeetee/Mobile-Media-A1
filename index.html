			<p><i>Collection-Camera</i> is an interactive app that allows users to search the entire Te Papa Collections Online library using their phone camera.</p>
			<p>It has a very minimal interface, only a large camera view and a little text card down the bottom. It is made to be as simple as possible and quick so that it seems like magic for the user.</p>
			<p>The app will continually poll the servers or a local service (depending on efficientcy) with the most recent image to try find a match. Scroll to see what happens next.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" id="takephoto">
			<p>From polling every second, the app has found a viable match using the existing images in the Te Papa Collections database. It shows you some basic information on the bottom of the screen, as well as an actual image taken from the database </p>
			<p>The user can swipe up on the information at the bottom of the screen to get more information about this piece.
			<a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/1096437" target="_blank">A Flask.</a>

		</div>
		<div class ="row" id="moreinfo">
			<p>Here is the view from dragging or clicking on the last information panel. You can still see the live image feed in the background, however, while in this window, the app will not poll for new images. This design pattern is important as users don't want the whole page to disappear half way through reading.</p>
			<p>It might also be a good idea to have a link to the collections web page or a link to some other </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" id='disabledinfo'>
			<p>The app will also have a feature for vision impaired. Through selecting an option, users can enable a dictation mode. Directing the camera around will dictate what the title is of the pieces is, and by clicking on the screen, it will give the listener more detailed information about the work.</p>
			<p>If it was interested, here a tool could be added that continues my original idea of having the vision input feed into a maching learning alrogithm that ties semantic positioning to a few dimensions in audio, such as chords or pitch etc.</p>
